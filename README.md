I'm Sebastian from BogotÃ¡, Colombia. I'm a curious person and a passionate about self-learning and ideas. I prefer to work with a cup of coffee on my desk and The Killers as soundtrack. ğŸ”­ In this github you can find projects built on python mainly and some learning exercises with Golang or JS. Also I have some repos with ML implemetations for my underdegree thesis and another cool things. You can send me a message to ğŸ“« parada.celis@gmail.com
